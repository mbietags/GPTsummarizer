ChatGPT has created a plugin platform which allows developers to access up-to-date information, run computations, and access third-party services. The code for a knowledge base retrieval plugin has been open-sourced, and safeguards have been implemented to mitigate misuse. An experimental model called Browsing Alpha has been created which knows how to browse the internet, allowing language models to access information beyond the training corpus. OpenAI has also created an API specifically designed for language models, with a manifest file and retrieval plugin which enables ChatGPT to access personal or organizational information sources. OpenAI is a platform that allows users to index and search documents, as well as provide security considerations. It also enables third-party plugins to be used in conversations on chat.openai.com and the documentation for these plugins is shown to the language model as part of the conversation context. OpenAI is continuing to develop more plugins and make them available to a wider audience.
